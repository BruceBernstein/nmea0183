README for nmea0183 test parser

This program implements the Getaround Embedded Software Coding Exercise.

To compile:
make

To run:
make test:

The data file has a couple of deliberate errors in it to generate messages and test error handling.

The program will exit after writing 100 lines of data.

Most of the data is the same, copied and pasted from the only two GPRMC sentences in the file (which was originally sourced from the WikiPedia NMEA 0183 article.

Implementation notes:

I implemented a few general purpose read/parse functions, but hard-coded the result generation in main().  This loss of generality is a result of time constraints.
The specification was ambiguous in terms of whther the program needed to create a pipe.   I chose to assume that the input would be piped into stdin.
There was no specification as to how to deliver the output file, so I chose to write it to stdout and let the shell write the file.   The idea of saving 100 lines and writing the output was juxtaposed in the spec, so I assumed they were talking about the same thing.

I used fixed buffers on the stack because I didn't see any examples which would require a more general approach.
I used a flexible indexing scheme rather than a sequential custom parse because I thought the few "rewinds" would not be significant compared to the I/O time.
